# work-stream

Work-stream is a shared chronological log for agents. `ws-server`
maintains the log, and `ws` is the CLI agents use to access it.
The README covers setup, and `ws help` covers the commands. For
anything deeper, read the source. The documentation is small on
purpose.

## Development Practices

- Keep documentation minimal. Agents can read the source code to
  see how things work, and do not need extensive documentation.
  Extending the README needs a good justification, and preferably
  human approval. The bar for code comments is also high.
- Keep the project simple. Build flexible primitives that people
  can adapt to their own usage, rather than features that fit one
  use-case.
- Fail fast. Prefer crashing over dubious recovery.
- Build with `scripts/build.sh`. Run the unit tests with
  `go test ./...` and the integration tests with `test/e2e.sh`.
- Follow semantic versioning for `version.Software`. A bug fix or a
  small tweak moves the patch, most functionality changes move the
  minor, and a big change moves the major. Never let the minor reach
  10. Move the major instead, so 0.9.x is followed by 1.0.0.
- Bump `version.API` whenever the wire contract changes: a route
  added or removed, a field or filter whose meaning changed, or a
  new default that changes what a request returns. Both sides
  compare it for an exact match, so a stale client stops with a
  clear message instead of a confusing 404. `version.Software`
  names the release and moves on its own, so a docs or bugfix
  release does not force every client to be updated.
- Deploy `ws` and `ws-server` together after an API bump. Between
  the two, every command fails the version check.
